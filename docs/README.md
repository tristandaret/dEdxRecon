# docs — generated documentation and how to read it

This directory contains Doxygen-generated documentation for the
project. It is intended for reviewers who want to read class and
function-level documentation without browsing source files.

How to inspect

- Open `docs/doxygen/html/index.html` in a web browser to navigate the
  generated API pages (class lists, files, inheritance diagrams).

Notes

- The generated docs include the Doxygen comments embedded in header
  files and are a convenient way for non-developers to understand the
  responsibilities of each component.
