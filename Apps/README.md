# Apps — small drivers and entry points

This folder contains small application entry points that invoke the
reconstruction and monitoring flows defined elsewhere in the
repository. Examples include `Analysis.cxx` which triggers monitoring
and `DrawOut.cxx` for visualization output.

These binaries are research drivers: they exercise pipelines, create
plots or dumps and were used to iterate on algorithms rather than as
production services.

If you want a demo or curated runnable example, I can prepare a
small self-contained driver and build instructions.
